# Web-Crawler
Web Crawler in Python

This code crawls web pages and extracts information while tokenizing the data collected and creating an inverted index.
It also calculates indegrees and outdegrees as well as their ratios which can be used to do page ranking.

Crawler2.py is the main file and tokenizing.py is a class imported in the main file.

Several files stored along with the code are made through the code itself. You can remove these files and start with a fresh link.
Files like inv_index.pkl, outdegree.pkl etc. are pickle files. These files are dictionaries that are stored as it is and reused in the code.
